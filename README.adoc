# Neo4J serve

### The problem

So you whipped up a little Java app,
with an embedded Neo4J server,
and imported some data into it.

Now the data is there in a directory,
and you're wondering how to use Neo4J browser to visualize and play with the data.

It's OK.  I did that, too.

### The solution

All you need to do is to serve the directory to the browser.

#### How?

Build this project:

  ./gradlew iD

Launch the resulting application:

  ./build/install/neo4j-serve/bin/neo4j-serve -p 9000 ../path/to/your/database

You will also need to start the neo4j service (and that is also the reason you cannot use the
default port for neo4j-serve):

  neo4j start

Now visit the http://localhost:7474 in your browser
and, in the Settings tab, under "Network Connection",
set the Bolt URI to "localhost:9000".

After a little while, you should see your data in the browser.

### Caveats

You need to stop this server whenever you want to modify the data via the original method.
